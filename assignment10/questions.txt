1. How can Jarnik's algorithm be re-configured to find the maximum-spanning-tree instead of the minimum-spanning-tree?
    you can invert the comparison operator so that it returns the greater weight not the lower one.

2. How is a minimum-spanning-tree different from a solution to The Traveling Salesman problem?
    MST connects the vertexes with the least weighted edges. Traveling salesman tries to travel to all of them.
    To use an analogy, it is the difference between creating a road to connect cities with the least concrete and traveling the least distance on the road to visit each city.

3. Rewrite 5 vertices from the weighted graph cityGraph2 from test.cpp in adjacency matrix form. You can enter a text table yourself in your answers file, or copy and paste a text table from https://www.tablesgenerator.com/text_tables or add an additional image/spreadsheet file to your repository or put a link in question 3 to a Google Sheet. It's your call.

4. What is the Big-O time complexity of Jarnik's algorithm when a priority queue (binary heap) is used? What about when it is not used? Why is there a difference?
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/prims-minimum-spanning-tree-mst-greedy-algo-5/
   With binary heap, O((E+V) log V)
   Without binary heap, O(V^2)

5. Why is Jarnik's algorithm a greedy algorithm?
The algorithm is greedy because it always adds the lowest weight edge that expands the tree without considering

6. Jarnik's algorithm is commonly known as Prim's algorithm, even though Jarnik discovered it and published it decades before Prim rediscovered it. Research another algorithm that has a different common name from its original discoverer. What is the purpose of the algorithm and why did its original creator not get credit?
Cooley-Tukey algorithm is a fast fourier transform algorithm that was originally invented by Carl Freidrich Gauss in 1805 to interpolate the trajectories of asteroids.
It was only published posthumously in 1876 in a dying form of the latin language
It was named after James Cooley and John Tukey who rediscovered it in 1965 and described its implementation on a computer.
With computers the algorithm became easier to use and gained popularity
Years after Tukey and Cooley published their paper it was discovered that Gauss had invented the algorithm 160 years ago.
