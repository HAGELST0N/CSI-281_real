1. You can invert the comparison operator so that it returns the greater weight not the lower one.

2. MST connects the vertexes with the least weighted edges. Traveling salesman tries to travel to all of them.
To use an analogy, it is the difference between creating a road to connect cities with the least concrete and traveling the least distance on the road to visit each city.

      With binary heap, O((E+V) log V)
      Without binary heap, O(V^2)

5. The algorithm is greedy because it always adds the lowest weight edge that expands the tree
without considering previous or future decisions this is known as making locally optimal choices.

6. Cooley-Tukey algorithm is a fast fourier transform algorithm that was originally invented by Carl Freidrich Gauss in 1805 to interpolate the trajectories of asteroids.
It was only published posthumously in 1876 in a dying form of the latin language
It was named after James Cooley and John Tukey who rediscovered it in 1965 and described its implementation on a computer.
With computers the algorithm became easier to use and gained popularity
Years after Tukey and Cooley published their paper it was discovered that Gauss had invented the algorithm 160 years ago.
